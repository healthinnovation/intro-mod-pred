Statistical learning refers to a set of tools for modeling and understanding complex datasets.
Statistical learning theory is the theory that explores ways of estimating functional dependency or association from a given collection of data.
We consider the learning problem as a problem of finding a desired dependence or association using a limited number of observations.
To extract important patterns and trends, and understanding what the data says. We call this learning from data.
